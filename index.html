    <h1>Somaiyah Hafeez</h1>
    <p> Hey, I am Somaiyah, a data journalist and reporter based in New York City. 
      I am current pursuing a master's in Data Journalism from Columbia Journalism School. I will be graduating in August 2025 from the program and will be open to work. 
      Prior to this, I worked as a freelance journalist for more than a dozen national and international news outlets.
      I have written for <em>The Guardian, New Lines Magazine, The New Humanitarian </em> and <em>The Diplomat</em> to name some.

    <p> My <a href="https://kontinentalist.com/stories/no-justice-for-balochistan-enforced-disappearances"> 
      data-driven investigation on enforced disappearances in Balochistan </a>, the largest province of Pakistan, resulted in me being a 
      finalist for <a href="https://www.thomsonfoundation.org/latest/somaiyah-hafeez-finalist-for-young-journalist-of-the-year-2024/"> Thomson Foundation's Young Journalist Award in 2024. </a>
