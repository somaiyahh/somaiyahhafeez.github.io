    <h1>Somaiyah Hafeez</h1>
    <p> Data journalist and reporter based in New York City. 
      I am current pursuing a master's in Data Journalism from Columbia Journalism School. 
      Prior to this, I worked as a freelance journalist for more than a dozen national and international news outlets.
      I have written for The Guardian, New Lines Magazine, The New Humanitarian and The Diplomat to name some.

    <p> My <a href="https://kontinentalist.com/stories/no-justice-for-balochistan-enforced-disappearances"> data-driven investigation on enforced disappearances in Balochistan </a>, the largest province of Pakistan, resulted in me being a finalist for Thomson Foundation's Young Journalist of The Year Award in 2024.
